# Domain Problem

- 

--Datasets contains frendship between students in high school in December 2013 through serval techiniques.


- Research Question & Domain Problem

--

  - Observe which individual is the most popular students in this network.

--

  - As a freshment student could utilize this network to get to know the classmates so that to have a better school experience especially in the American Classroom set up.
  
--

  - User needs to analyze the relationship between each individual through what class they are taking, who are they friend with.

# Data / Operation Abstraction

```{r setup, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
library(dplyr)
```


```{r glimpse, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
head(nasaweather::storms, 3)
```

--

- Data types - Geo-spatial, temporal, numerical & categorical

--

- Identify storm season details for each year, & range of dates

--

- Identify storm details - name, max severity, max wind speed, whether it was active on any particular day

--

- Atmospheric temperature converted from Kelvin to Celcius

--

- Filter atmospheric data for the focussed geographical zone, & get monthly averages of temperature & air pressure.

---
name: interaction

# Encoding / Interaction Design

- Application to be responsive to user inputs and visually plot spatial information over map.

--

- View overall storm patterns for the selected year and time period. Visually identify active storms at any point in time.

--

- Track progress of storms on a daily basis & identify storm location & category.

--

- Pinpoint individual storms in the map & gather details about them.

--

- Visually compare year-over-year changes in storm wind speed & air pressure pattern.

--

- Compare monthly atmospheric temperatures across years to understand correlation between temperature & storm patterns.

---
name: dashboard

# Visual Dashboard

#### Libraries used

- ggplot2, ggthemes, ggridges, dplyr, lubridate, sf, natural-earth map data

--

- leaflet, plotly, datatable, formattable

--

- shiny, shiny dashboard, shinythemes, xaringan, xaringan themes

#Next Steps / Future Work

--

- Use predictive algorithms to understand the correlation between different atmospheric variables and predict storm paths for future storms.

--

- Use additional data analysis techniques to explore the data and gain insights.

--

- Use better visualization options to create more responsive & faster visualizations.
