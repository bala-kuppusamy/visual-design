# Domain Problem

- Tropical cyclone paths & atmospheric measurements in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico from 1995 to 2000.

--

- Research Question & Domain Problem

--

  - Observe past hurricane patterns for year-over-year comparison and identify safe shipping routes based on time of the year.

--

  - As a shipping routes planner, user needs to track & forecast storm patterns during hurricane seasons to identify safe shipping routes.

--

  - User needs to analyze the correlation between atmospheric temperature, pressure & storm patterns, if any.

# Data / Operation Abstraction

```{r setup, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
library(dplyr)
```


```{r glimpse, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
head(nasaweather::storms, 3)
```

--

- Data types - Geo-spatial, temporal, numerical & categorical

--

- Identify storm season details for each year, & range of dates

--

- Identify storm details - name, max severity, max wind speed, whether it was active on any particular day

--

- Atmospheric temperature converted from Kelvin to Celcius

--

- Filter atmospheric data for the focussed geographical zone, & get monthly averages of temperature & air pressure.

---
name: interaction

# Encoding / Interaction Design

- Application to be responsive to user inputs and visually plot spatial information over map.

--

- View overall storm patterns for the selected year and time period. Visually identify active storms at any point in time.

--

- Track progress of storms on a daily basis & identify storm location & category.

--

- Pinpoint individual storms in the map & gather details about them.

--

- Visually compare year-over-year changes in storm wind speed & air pressure pattern.

--

- Compare monthly atmospheric temperatures across years to understand correlation between temperature & storm patterns.

#Next Steps / Future Work

--

- Use predictive algorithms to understand the correlation between different atmospheric variables and predict storm paths for future storms.

--

- Use additional data analysis techniques to explore the data and gain insights.

--

- Use better visualization options to create more responsive & faster visualizations.
