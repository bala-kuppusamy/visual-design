# Helpful Definitions

- **Degree**: How many direct, 'one hop' connections each node has to other nodes within the network. *Very connected individuals, popular individuals.*

--

- **Eigen Centrality**: How well connected a node is, and how many links their connections have, and so on through the network. *A good ‘all-round’ SNA score.*

--

- **Closeness**: Measures ‘closeness’ to all other nodes within the network. Calculates shortest paths between all nodes, then assigns each node a score based on its sum of shortest paths. *Individuals who are best placed to influence the entire network most quickly. Good ‘broadcasters’.*

--

- **Betweeness**: Measures number of times a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes. This measure shows which nodes act as 'bridges' between nodes in a network. *Individuals who influence the flow around a system.*
