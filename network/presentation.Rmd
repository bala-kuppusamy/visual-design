# Helpful Definitions

- Centrality: How many direct,  connections each 'one hop' node has to other nodes within the network.

--

- Closeness: This measure calculates the shortest paths between all nodes, then assigns each node a score based on its sum of shortest paths.

--

- Betweeness: This measure shows which nodes act as 'bridges' between nodes in a network. It does this by identifying all the shortest paths and then counting how many times each node falls on one.
